        <h1>Tic tac toe</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the programming skill assessment task, and congratulations on making it this far!
          Let's build a simple game.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img id="tictactoe-white" src="tictactoe-white.svg">

    <div id="content-objective">
      <h1>Objective</h1>
      <p>
        We want to know your coding style and ability. To do this, we want you to make us a playable game
        of tic-tac-toe - you can implement it on the <a href="#content-frontend">frontend</a> or on the
        <a href="#content-backend">backend</a>, whatever you feel comfortable with. Continue scrolling to
        see the requirements for whichever context you choose.
      </p>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        You can implement the project whichever way you see fit - however, it must be your own work. This means
        you are of course allowed to use external libraries, but the solution must come from you. You must mention
        every external source you have used (both libraries and any code snippets you have copied) and explain
        your reasoning behind it.
      </p>
      <h2>Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        Please deliver the completed project as a GitHub repository we have access to, complete with
        a nice README file. If you are not used to GitHub, don't worry, simply zip your project and send it
        to us, along with a readme.txt file.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="content-frontend">
      <h2>Frontend</h2>
      <p>
        So you have chosen to implement tic-tac-toe as a frontend game. We would therefore like to see
        how advanced your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills are.
      </p>
      <div id="frameworks-frontend">
        <img id="angular" src="angular.svg" />
        <img id="react" src="react.svg" />
        <img id="vue" src="vue.svg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The design must consist of a simple grid with Xs and Os. These can be rendered using whatever you
        want - if you want to flex your designing muscle you can use custom SVGs, if you want to show your
        use of libraries, use an icon library. We do not mind if it is the prettiest game on earth, but
        make it as nice as you know how to. If you know how to do CSS effects, use them! If you know an
        awesome library, be our guest.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would prefer if this is implemented using a framework, if you are familiar with one. Our stack
        consists of React and emberjs, so either of these would be perfect. Vue and Angular also work,
        and if you are not familiar with a frontend framework, no worries - use jQuery or even vanilla
        JavaScript. But definitely use a framework if you are familiar with one. It's not the end of the
        world if you don't use one, so no worries.
      </p>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        You can implement this game either as a 2-player game or as a player-vs-computer game. You should
        be able to choose who starts. There should be a status bar, we'll go into that later. When someone
        wins, the game should start again, and the person who didn't start the last time gets to start this
        time. You should keep count of who has won how many times.
      </p>
      <h4>Grid</h4>
      <p>
        Nothing too crazy, a grid where the squares are clickable when it's your turn, and where you
        can see the Xs and Os.
      </p>
      <h4>Message overlay</h4>
      <p>
        An overlay that is used to communicate when someone has won. It should be shown over the grid.
      </p>
      <h4>Status bar</h4>
      <p>
        A simple status bar showing whose turn it is (X or O) and how many times each has won. It should
        also have a button to start/continue with a new game/restart.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="content-backend">
      <h2>Backend</h2>
      <p>
        So you have chosen to implement tic-tac-toe as a backend game. We would therefore like to see
        how advanced your API service skills are.
      </p>
      <div id="frameworks-backend">
        <img id="typescript" src="typescript.svg" />
        <img id="php" src="php.svg"/>
        <img id="python" src="python.svg" />
        <img id="laravel" src="laravel.svg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The design must consist of an API with a few endpoints. You can write this in any language you
        want, using any framework you want (or none at all). We use TypeScript, PHP and Python, so using
        any of these is a plus - especially if you can do it in Laravel, express or Koa. If you are not
        familiar with a backend framework, no worries - just develop it your way, as long as it works.
        But definitely use a framework if you are familiar with one. It's not the end of the world if
        you don't use one, so no worries.
      </p>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        You can implement this game either as a 2-player game or as a player-vs-computer game. All communication
        must be handled by endpoints, and all data must be returned as JSON.
      </p>
      <div class="endpoint">
        <h4><code>GET /</code></h4>
        <p>
          Should return the game state. It should initialize a new game if no game has been started before.
