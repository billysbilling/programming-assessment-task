This is a task designed to test the capabilities of new junior hires, through the implementation of
a game of tic-tac-tow. It is designed in plain vanilla HTML and CSS, so all files simply need to be
uploaded to the same folder and served through [index.html](index.html).

## Deploying
Right now this task is deployed in [AWS bucket **billysbilling** in folder 
**billy/programming-assessment-task/**
](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/billysbilling?prefix=billy%2Fprogramming-assessment-task%2F&region=us-east-1#).
Deployment is done by uploading all files in the [src/](src/) folder to this bucket and making them all public.
